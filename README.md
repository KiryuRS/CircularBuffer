# CircularBuffer [Generic Data Structure]
This documentation describes about the implementation of a Circular Buffer data structure. Circular Buffer (also known as Ring Buffer) is where data is stored in a repeated loop (circular fashion). On every instances where a value gets pushed into the array, it appends to the "back" of the array. If the new value "overshots" the array, the old one will be replaced. More details can be found in [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer).
